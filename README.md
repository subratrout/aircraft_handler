### The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate programming ability by developing a simple software subsystem. Work can be done in any language.#### A software subsystem of an air-traffic control system is defined to manage a queue of aircraft (AC) in an airport.  The aircraft queue is managed by a process that responds to three types of requests:  1.	System boot used to start the system.  2.	Enqueue aircraft used to insert a new AC into the system.  3.	Dequeue aircraft used to remove an AC from the system.AC’s have at least (but are not limited to having) the following properties:  1.	AC type:  Passenger or Cargo  2.	AC size:  Small or LargeThe process that manages the queue of AC’s satisfies the following:  1.	There is no limit to the number of AC’s it can manage.  2.	Dequeue aircraft requests result in selection of one AC for removal such that:a.	Passenger AC’s have removal precedence over Cargo AC’s.b.	Large AC’s of a given type have removal precedence over Small AC’s of the same type.c.	Earlier enqueued AC’s of a given type and size have precedence over later enqueued AC’s of the same type and size.
